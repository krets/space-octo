## ToDo

 - Pickups spawned into Asteroids group
 - smarter despawn of asteroids
   - explosion of first item in Asteroids list is too simple; may be on screen or near screen
   - base on distance from player?
 - Add trail to objects to show speed (shader or particle?)
   - texturerec gradiant is clunky and has hard edges
 - Audio:
   - thrust
   - shoot
   - damage
   - pickup
 - Pickups affect apsects of player (no need for HUD counters)
   - blue -> increase shield size
	 - shield size controls pickup zone
	 - shield takes damage for player
   - pink -> scales size and damage of projectile
   - green -> restores health to player ship
